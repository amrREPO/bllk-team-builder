# Blue Lock Team Builder
This is a fairly rudimentary project in a format I am not particularly familiar with so excuse any jank. 

 This website allows you to build your own Blue Lock team, FIFA style.
    - Formation Selection: Choose from various formations to create your ideal team.
    
    - Squad Selection: Select a team to choose players from.
    
    - Click and Click: Click player to highlight from either your formation or on the side bar and then click on another player or empty node to swap.
    
    - Player Info: Hover player's name to show image, name, and overall.
